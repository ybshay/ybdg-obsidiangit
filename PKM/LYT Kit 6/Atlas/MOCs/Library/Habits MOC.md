###### Navigate with your new MOC
Connect your new MOC with the the rest of your network of knowledge so you can *navigate your notes near the speed of thought*. 

Enjoy the spatial constellation you created. Your MOCs will be meaningful to you. 

Use your more mature MOCs for different purposes:

- for final products (content creation)
- as a reference point in the future, as a navigational hub
- for the inherent joy the ideas provide.

As you finish work on an area of interest, the MOC remains as a renewable summation of thought for the future you. An MOC is your easy access point back into the topicâ€”whether that's tomorrow or in ten years.

# Habits MOC
*I am an unrelenting evolutionary adaptationâ€”whether you like it or it!*

Here's an assembly of the notes in some sort of formalized structure. I have continued adding to this whenever it made sense.

## Understanding Habits
- [[Defining a habit]]
- [[Habit formation provides an evolutionary advantage]]
- [[Habits carry a ton of hidden inertia]]
- [[The neural formation of habits is additive]]
	- [[The truest habit metaphors are additive]]
	- [[Ant pheromone trails act like potential habits]]

## Designing Habits
- [[Understanding the habit cycle and habitual cues]]
	- [[How Atomic Habits fit into the conversation on habits]]
	- [[Resiliency Routines help regain a sense of control]]
	- [[Improving Micro Habits at the Point of Contact]]
- [[Small Wins foster a Sense of Control]]
- [[An asymptotic curve models the development of skills, strength, habits, and more]]
	- [[The mechanism for breaking through development plateaus]]

### Example of Habit Design
- [[Charting out habit cycles in my life circa 2013]]

### Important Habits
[[Important habits preserve mental clarity and a sense of control]]
[[Preparing for the next day is an important habit]]
[[Journaling in the morning is an important habit]]
[[Writing down daily goals in the morning is an important habit]]
