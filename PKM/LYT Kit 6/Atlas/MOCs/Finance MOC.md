# Finance MOC Example
Keep tabs on your personal finances and health-related info.

For you, here are some examples to consider...

There are some areas of finance (like managing taxes) that work well in basic computer folders, PDFs, and spreadsheets; but those areas can easily integrate with the financial sensemaking and management you can achieve in a link-based system.

It's fine to leave some documents or projects within apps that are better-suited to handle them. But *notes* about these documents or projects can help you further reflect, ideate, or push goals forward. 

You might even find an excellent balance between managing projects outside of your core PKM tool, while spending time examining them in this space for a more mindful perspective.
