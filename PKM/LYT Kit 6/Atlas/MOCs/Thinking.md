## Definitions
Let's define some overlapping conceptual categories:

-   **Concept**: A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism that has been given a name.
-   **Mental Models** are specific readily-available patterns or mechanisms thatâ€”*when applied to a current situation or thing*â€”allow for efficient, optimal action. Great for strategic agency and in-the-moment adaptability.
-   **Metaphors** are primarily for relating unlike things. Great for creative expression and a means unto itself.
-   [[Refraction Thinking]] is primarily for broadening perspective and deepening understanding. Great for reviewing, planning, empathizing, and meditating.

2. [[Bottom-up thinking]]
3. Middle-out thinking
