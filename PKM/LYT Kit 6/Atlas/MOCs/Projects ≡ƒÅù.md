# Projects 🏗
Manage your projects with linked frameworks. A few notes:

- Most projects need *less* maintenance work, not more. 
- Don't micro-manage yourself. 
- Keep it spartan. 
- Give yourself a broad direction and let your ingenuity surprise you.

My projects are a bit too private to share publicly in the LYT Kit. So this is just a placeholder note for you to work with.

### Commentary

While everyone is different, I have found that I really don't like polluting my note-making space with tasks and todos that lose their value to me in the weeks, months, and years to come. Sometimes I dust off a [[ToDo]] note and attempt a new tiny test on managing tasks. But it never lasts long. 

While "projects" and "ideas" overlap substantially, I find an unrelenting need to maintain a distinction—and a space—to allow writings and works to grow without the shadow of a "project" looming over them. When you want that freer sense, go to the [[The Studio 🎨]].
