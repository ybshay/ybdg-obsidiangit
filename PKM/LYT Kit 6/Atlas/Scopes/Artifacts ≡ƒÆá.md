# Artifacts ðŸ’ 
Artifacts are distinct *outputs* you have shared. They are works captured in time. 

Don't be a completionist and try to log every version of every output you share. Why do it at all then? Because this is how you avoid the dreaded "I know I wrote about that somewhere..."

## Newsletter outputs
```dataview
table dates
from #output/newsletter 
sort dates asc
```
