# The LYT Workshop
Perhaps the most profound online learning experience known to humanity.

Linking Your Thinking is a workshop where you'll work to create your custom PKM system. PKM stands for Personal Knowledge Management. It is a way of working with your ideas in your notes so you can be a better thinker.

**Build Your Custom PKM¬†System Now**
Linking Your Thinking is a 6-week hands-on workshop that will teach, train, and support you in building a custom knowledge management system you can trust. 

- Learn how to never lose your ideas again. 
- Connect and create meaningful insights.
- Rediscover the joy of thinking.

---

The LYT workshop is also a community-driven learning experience. So you'll have a great time learning more from and with your fellow crew members.

The live workshop runs for 6 weeks. But you can continue to work with your PKM system and connect with others after that because all members will have lifetime access to the curriculum and alumni community.

Linking Your Thinking is all about making a change in your relationship with knowledge.
