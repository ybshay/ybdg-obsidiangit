# Small Wins foster a Sense of Control
In the literature, which I've forgotten, one of the most apparent attributes in building up desired habits is the concept of small wins. 

Small Wins encourage [[Flow]]; and Flow encourages itself, so it's fair to say that: Small Wins create a [[Positive Feedback Loop]]. In terms of making notes in our PKM systems, [[Progressive Ideation]].

I remember one example from "The Happiness Advantage" by Shawn Achor. He wants to play the guitar more, so he removes it from the closet and places in prominently in his house. Now that he sees it, he plays it. This is also a strong instance of an important concept: [[Out of Sight, Out of Mind]]. 

He also references people going to bed with their workout clothes onâ€”or at least next to their bed. If you want to work out in the morning, that's a sure-fire way to remove all friction from the choice. It decreases the [[Activation Energy]] required, making it more likely to be done.
