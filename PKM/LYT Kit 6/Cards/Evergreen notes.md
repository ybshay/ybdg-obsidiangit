# Evergreen notes
Note-takers _“churn and burn”_ through their notes. They take them for a specific short-term (“just-in-time”) purpose—like a test or a project. When the milestone concludes, the notes lose their value. This type of note-taking doesn’t accumulate long-term value.

Note-makers _“know and grow”_ with their knowledge. Instead of losing value, note-makers create **living notes** that are able to grow in value and evolve over time.

### Properties of living, evergreen notes

    - You will find this is a forcing function to naturally draw out your unique perspective.
- **Linked** - Your living, evergreen notes should have links to other notes.
    - You will naturally make links if you’ve made clear notes in your own words.
- **Non-static** - As you encounter new things in life, you can re-write or re-factor your notes to capture more meaning and value.
    - This means evergreen notes become living entities—gaining in insights and complexity as more time passes.
