*You requested the latest TPS reports?*

Do you ever wish you could save a search? You can. Saved searches are called "queries".

Datascopes are notes with specific sets of queries. Such as:

- [[Ideas âœ¨ (Kit)]]
- [[Prominent People ðŸŒ‹ (Kit)]]

As you can see, **datascopes** give you viewports to filter, review, and analyze the information you are accreting. 

> On your LYT ship, datascopes are your various viewports.

Armed with a few datascopes, you can make confident decisions because you know you are getting accurate information.

### What's the difference between MOCs and datascopes
While [[MOCs (defn)]] are for active, generative thinking, the value of datascopes come from how they *passively* provide you with updated views of information. 

You can analyze or act on that information; but information is worthless without putting meaningful context around it. 

-   Use MOCs to generate insights
-   Use datascopes to analyze information

Using a series of queries to build datascopes is an advanced action. But many people want to learn becauseâ€”in sage handsâ€”queries are crazy-powerful.
