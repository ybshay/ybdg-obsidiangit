# MOC (Map of Content) 
*pronounced (EM-OH-SEE)*

A note that mainly has links to other notes, thus "mapping" the contents of multiple notes in your digital library.  

While an MOC can function as a boring index, it is actually an entirely new thinking tool that can take your ideation to the next level. 

MOCs help you *gather, develop, and navigate your ideas*.
