# Carl Sagan
Carl Sagan has earned my highest praise out of basically anyone I know. [[1980 ðŸ“º  Cosmos - A Personal Voyage (Carl Sagan)]] was an internal inflection point within me. 



###### Pale Blue Dot: Chapter 3, *The Great Demotions*
Sagan calls the "Great Demotions" moments in scientific history that downgraded humanity's place in the universe. Galileo helped to show that the Earth was not the only "world" along with it not being the center of the universe, bringing about another great demotion. Other great demotions have occurred, however, such as our discovery that we do not live in the only galaxy, or that our galaxy is not at the center of the universe or that no other star has planets. Today we have even discovered planets orbiting other stars.
