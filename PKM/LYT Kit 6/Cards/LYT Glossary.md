- **[[LYT Kit|LYT]]** - An acronym for "Linking Your Thinking".
### LYT Terms
- **[[Home|Home note]]** - Your Home note is your north star, navigating you to your MOCs. It keeps the entire system organized.
- **[[MOCs Overview|MOC (Map of Content)]]**, pronounced (EM-OH-SEE) - A note that mainly has links to other notes, thus "mapping" the contents of multiple notes in your digital library. 
	- MOCs help you gather, develop, and navigate your ideas.
- **[[Evergreen notes]]** - Evergreen notes are centered on a single idea and written mostly in your own words. They naturally accrue more links over time.
- **[[Fluid Frameworks]]** - Any helpful framework, or structure, that helps but doesn't hinder note retrieval and/or idea management. They are adaptable, fitting your evolving needs.
- **[[Mental Squeeze Point]]** - The point in any endeavor where the amount of information begins to overwhelm you. Either you overcome the squeeze point, or your project gets stuck.
- **Top-down Thinking** - Starting with structure and a clear destination. e.g. A folder-based framework.
	- PRO: Keeps you on track. CON: Stifles emergent thinking.
- **Bottom-up Thinking** - Starting with a various ideas and connecting them organically. 
	- PRO: Allows for emergent thinking. CON: Can feel a little too chaotic at times. 
- **Middle-out Thinking** - Developing a fluid structure that creates simultaneous cycles of top-down and bottom-up thinking. e.g. LYT!
	- PRO: Encourages next level thinking. BUT: Requires learning the technique and being able to balance structure/chaos. 
- **[[Refraction Thinking]]** - Thinking about ONE thing, through the lens of ANOTHER thing.
