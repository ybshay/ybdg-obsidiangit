# Framing
*I'm the hidden 500 pound gorilla that underpins all human communication.*

%% add more examples, this is a big concept %% 

If you hear, "this doesn't cost $1000, it only costs $50!" That sounds great because it's been framed in context to $1000. But even $50 is a lot for a pen that writes upside down.

### Wiki
*The Framing Effect*: People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented. Gain and loss are defined in the scenario as descriptions of outcomes (e.g., lives lost or saved, disease patients treated and not treated, etc.).

In the social sciences, framing comprises a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives on how individuals, groups, and societies, organize, perceive, and communicate about reality. Framing can manifest in thought or interpersonal communication.
