# On the process of making MOCs
*(This is a post on the Obsidian Discourse that led to a download of file. Those files are now in the LYT Kit)*
It's no secret that some people (okay, mostly me) believe MOCs (Maps of Content) to be one of the ultimate thinking tools. 

This quick kit is to get you immediately hands-on with a practical example of utilizing an MOC to think and create. It goes through a 3-stage lifecycle. 

As always, experiment, learn by doing, and see how these methods might work for you! Included:

- 32 Notes
- A practical 3-stage example of utilizing an MOC

MOC Fluffing:
MOCs help us get us Mental Squeeze Points, encourage awesome thinking, create favorable conditions for flow, allow us to create meaningful spatial constellations of thought, have limitless interpretations, and are non-destructive, non-limiting because they act as fluid, augmented layers.

Enjoy!
