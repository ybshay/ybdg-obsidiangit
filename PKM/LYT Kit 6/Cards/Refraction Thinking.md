# Refraction Thinking
*Thinking about ONE thing, through the lens of ANOTHER thing.*

An enjoyable and non-efficient way of thinking about a Thing, is to place several different lenses in front of it. In the optometry office, they call this device a Phoropter. For the purposes of thinking, we'll call this technique spending time in "Refraction-based thinking".

"Refraction" has a different goal than "action". Refraction is for broadening perspective and deepening understanding. Action is about getting things done. Both are essential. Too much refraction and you fall into Hamlet's trap, who even though he knew his uncle murdered his father, procrastinated from decisive action because of "paralysis by analysis".

Applying "refraction" to our thinking is similar to applying a "mental model", but they tend to stand apart because of the purpose. While Refraction is primarily for broadening perspective and deepening understanding, the use of "Mental Models" is primarily for pattern recognition for efficient, optimal action. The answer here is quite simply to find a balance. (See: [[Yin and Yang]])

When spending time in Refraction Mode, each lens you hold up offers a different view; some more valuable than others, all part of the process.

*What is Refraction?* Refraction is the turning or bending of any wave, such as a light or sound wave, when it passes from one medium into another of different optical density.
