# Mapping the flexible flow of ideas
Ideas are slippery. Where do they come from? When do they become projects? How can they continue to provide value?

> If you can clarify your ideas, you can clarify your efforts. 

What does that mean for how I manage my notes?

| How to map the flexible flow of ideas | Example                | 
|:------------------------------------- |:---------------------- |
| Ideas get temporary tags              | `#idea/spaceship🚀`   |
| Projects get temporary tags      | `#project/active` |
| Essays get tags that stay                   | `#essay/2022`       |
| Artifacts get tags that stay      | `#output/newsletter`    |

- Some idea and projects tags are not as temporary. Some example for you might be: 
	- `#idea/parked🚙`, `#project/dropped`, `#project/landed🪐`, and `#project/archive`.
- Don't be a perfectionist with your tags. Use them to aid your efforts.

Practically and quickly, it would look like this:

- Stuff you encounter can become Sparks
	- Sparks can become Ideas
		- Ideas can become Essays
			- Essays can become Artifacts
				- Sharing artifacts allows the process to iterate
		- Ideas can become Projects
			- The results from projects helps the process to iterate
