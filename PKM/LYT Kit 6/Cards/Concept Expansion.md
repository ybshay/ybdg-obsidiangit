# Concept Expansion
Take a word, any word, and just start using it in different ways. Each new instance expands our sense of the word.

Here's [[2009 ðŸ—£ Analogy as Core - Hofstadter (Kit)]]'s example of shadow: a shadow from the sunâ€¦then a snow shadowâ€¦then a rain shadowâ€¦a familial shadowâ€¦in the shadow of a big eventâ€¦the gulf stream. Suddenly instead of a tree casting a shadow on the ground, it's England casting a shadow on the northern parts of Scandinavia. 

This is a bigger concept than first meets the eye. It's a sneaky rhetorical device that's used all the time. Be careful not to overuse it yourself. A good example of being caught up in your own overuse is someone's insistence on force-fitting the term "Barbell Method" to describe reading something once lightly, and a second time more deeply. It stretches the definition so much as to befuddle.
