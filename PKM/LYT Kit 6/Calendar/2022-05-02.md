## At a glance

> [!HINT]- Advanced tip
> The code below pulls in all the notes you created or touched on this day. 
> 
> If you are not intimidated, you can figure out how to put this in a reusable template.

> [!HINT]- This Datascope ðŸ”¬ only renders in the free downloadable version.
> You won't be able to see the magic unless you [download the kit](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/download-lyt-kit).
> 
> Also, my "created" and "modified" dates will all show the last date I copied this vault, so they are not the most realistic set of notes.
