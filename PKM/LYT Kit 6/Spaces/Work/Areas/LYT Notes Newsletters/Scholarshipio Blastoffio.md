*"Like a string of beads, it is our unique differences and intricacies that make us so appealing and attractive."* - Lindsey Lunsford, M.E.M., Second Edition DEI Fellow  
  
It would break my heart if the reason you can't attend is because of where you were born. That's not right. It's important to me—and crucial for all of our thinking—that we have a diverse mixture of perspectives.

SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATIONS ARE CLOSED FOR WORKSHOP 4.

SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATIONS WILL OPEN FOR WORKSHOP 5, AROUND JANUARY 10, 2022. STAY TUNED.
