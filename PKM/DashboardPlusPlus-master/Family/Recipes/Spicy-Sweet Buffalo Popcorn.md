# Ingredients
- Original recipe yields 8 servings
- Ingredient Checklist
	-   cooking spray 
	-   8 cups popped popcorn 
	-   1 cup white sugar 
	-   ¼ cup water 
	-   ⅓ cup Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's®) 
	-   3 tablespoons butter, cut into small cubes 
	-   ½ teaspoon baking soda 
	-   ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)

# Directions
## Step 1
Spray a large bowl with cooking spray. Fill with popcorn.

## Step 2
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone pad.

## Step 3
Combine sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook, without stirring and swirling pan gently as needed, until sugar has melted and the caramel is a deep amber color, 8 to 12 minutes. Remove from heat.

## Step 4
Stir Buffalo sauce and butter carefully into the caramel; it will spit and bubble and may form a ball. Return to heat; bring to a boil, stirring until caramel is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in the baking soda and cayenne pepper.

## Step 5
Pour spicy caramel mixture carefully over the popcorn. Toss to completely coat, guarding your hands from the hot caramel. Spread the coated popcorn onto the prepared baking sheet.

## Step 6
Bake in the preheated oven until dry, 15 to 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes; stir.
