- Fixed-term part time job (less than 150 per week)
	- Adult minimum wage: $21.20/hour
		- 7-hour work week maximum (without getting benefit payment docked)
		- 21.20 x 7 = $148.40 per week
			- Would make my weekly disposable income $290.86, thus reducing my wait time to 6 weeks (almost half its total)
