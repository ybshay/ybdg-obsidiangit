- Mix & Edit windows
	- The edit window will probably be more important to memorise quickly given that the Mix window seems as if it's..
		- a little less complicated to use overall, as in there's a smaller amount of strongly distinct features
		- moreso suited for specialised elements of audio production (i.e. tweaking with plugins, getting the smoothest transitions from high to low volume etc)
	- It'll probably be difficult for me to remember the differences between each edit mode. Slip mode seems like it'll be the best to use the most often, so I think I'll just stick to that unless I really need to use a different mode (for whatever reason).
	- I haven't seen the method of using empty placeholder clips for spotting before. I've always just noted down the exact beginning and end of a clip on paper or something. I can see how the blank clip method might be just as convenient, though; but I guess that's all about personal preference.
