- Soundscape submission date
	- had about 30s roughly finished beforehand, polished it & pulled the rest together very roughly
- self directed 
	- went to campus to see if we were supposed to stay there, decided to try set up protools at home instead so i could focus better, protools didnt work so i had to go back to campus without any further progress
	- eventually asked some classmates for tips/second opinions (which was quite helpful)
