- Audio analysis: Whiplash short film
	- Personal notes
		- Original short
			- Footstep sounds are only used at the beginning; and the clap sounds are a little quieter than at the beginning as the scene progresses.
			- The anxious breathing is louder than the dialogue.
		- Second version
			- No loud clapping at the beginning.
			- The drumsticks hitting at the same time that the instructor claps is new.
			- The yelling from the instructor has less volume overall.
			- ProTools
	- Dashboard: Session properties dialog box

		- Tools 
			- Zoomer tool (F5)

			  Scrubber tool (F9)

		- Edit modes 
			- Shuffle mode: Clip movement constrained by other clips

			- Spot mode: Uses a dialog box to determine placement of clips by exact points of the timeline’s duration
				- Good for syncing audio to video
				- Saves original timestamp of clip
			- Grid mode: 
				- Good for keeping sounds synced to a tempo/rhythm
				- Relative grid mode: sounds can be moved to any point in timeline; but they keep their relation to the grid when returning to grid mode. This feature is good for making certain sounds just off-beat
			- Tracks
				- Creating new tracks
					- Ctrl (or command) - shift - n
					- Track creaton dialog box allows the selection of amount, format & type
				- Deleted tracks cannot be recovered, but deleting a file does not equal deleting the audio used within it (it’s saved in the clips bin)
