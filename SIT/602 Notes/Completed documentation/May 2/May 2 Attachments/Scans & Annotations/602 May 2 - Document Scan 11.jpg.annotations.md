Once these are fixed, on the Master Module go to Workstations and check
that the computer (MAC-ZAST2-2001) is under the "Connected" heading.
If not, grab the computer under "Network" and drag it across the screen to
one of the slots under the "Connected" heading. See Fig. 8.
Monitoring Section: See Fig. 3.
The knob under MAIN controls the level of the speakers.
The knob under Cues controls the level of the headphone signal.
Holding down the Talk button engages the talkback mic for the duration of
how long it is held down. Pressing the Talk button will dim any signals going
to Cue.
The talkback mic runs through channel 8 on the Audient preamp. This means
Channel 8 must constantly have phantom power enabled and have the gain
turned to 12 O'clock. Please leave these settings untouched even when
zeroing the desk and shutting down the studio.
